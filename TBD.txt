nasm stuck

BUG - showing wrong bin for 'resb 5' in debugger 
    - also for 'times 5 db 1'


BUG - spaces in brakets parse spacedHex

recreate scene with start addresses in URL?

   warrior that coi
   code with many comments

- on debug end, keep the war alive so that it would be possible to view state
  - what happens if the war ends while on Resume? - need to pause

- colors on players pane

- breakpoints in code
- data breakpoints
- watch language
- online live game?
- enable/disable players with checkbox
- code button should be red if code has errors
- add zombies
- show stack, show common area
- errors with html pointers on page to where should be pressed - change to link mouse pointer
- jump to line where mouse is pointing?
- choose load address using gui
- remove trailing spaces and the bottom of the asm text, looks bad when debugging

- check changes:

    https://github.com/YoavKa/corewars8086/releases/tag/v5

- cpu view can change values, show in red and is able to revert?

- try two players with the same name
- round (step) counter

- when not in debug mode don't update GUI
- GUI zoom by browser
- go to address when not a number - same as watch parsing
- check long pages of comments at the start of .asm and in the middle, in either the player above or in me

- all console.error, Console.error to message boxes
- disassembled asm does not compile 'MOV [SI], 0x7C6' missing 'byte' or 'word'


End of debug session:
   - War instance shouldn't die at the end so its content can be examined (memory scrolled, registers watches)
   - Debug should continue as long as there is any player alive

- don't disassemble lines that were in the original text
- export code to bin file


BUG - db "longstring" fucks up disassembly since it doesn't have the correct number of bytes of the string
BUG - fails to start debug doesn't find 'df...'
  db "abcdefghij"

  inc ax



minor BUG - parsing an opcode out of memory boundary reads wrong number
