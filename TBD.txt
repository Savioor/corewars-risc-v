  resb 3000000000  -memory
  resb -6  -assert

nasm stuck
  times 200000 inc bx

BUG - showing wrong bin for 'resb 5' in debugger 
    - also for 'times 5 db 1'


BUG - spaces in brakets parse spacedHex


graph window


nasm memory leak
   errors with dy 12, dz 12

check randomization similarity with real java

recreate scene with start addresses in URL?


debugger

   show in red things that were just changed

   code with many comments

- on debug end, keep the war alive so that it would be possible to view state
  - what happens if the war ends while on Resume? - need to pause


|| 

- colors on players pane

- breakpoints in edit
   - disallow setting in comment, label lines?

- data breakpoints

- online live game?
- enable/disable players with checkbox
- code button should be red if code has errors
- add zombies

- jump to line where mouse is pointing?

- remove trailing spaces and the bottom of the asm text, looks bad when debugging

- check changes:
    https://forum.codeguru.co.il/wp/?topic=silenterrors-debugger
    https://github.com/YoavKa/corewars8086/releases/tag/v5

- cpu view can change values, show in red and is able to revert?

- try two players with the same name

- when not in debug mode don't update GUI

- go to address when not a number - same as watch parsing. problem - default would not be hex anymore
- check long pages of comments at the start of .asm and in the middle, in either the player above or in me

- all console.error, Console.error to message boxes
- disassembled asm does not compile 'MOV [SI], 0x7C6' missing 'byte' or 'word'


End of debug session:
   - War instance shouldn't die at the end so its content can be examined (memory scrolled, registers watches)
   - Debug should continue as long as there is any player alive

- don't disassemble lines that were in the original text
- export code to bin file

- fix colors to be consistant, IP pointer
- check timing of - main memory using an Int8Array from GWT


- after war ended, change stop icon to re-run?

- work with tasm instead of nasm
- options window
  - nasm/tasm

- add GUI indicator of steps/second

- stop when current debugged player dies
- check what happens in debugger at 200,000 steps



minor BUG - parsing an opcode out of memory boundary reads wrong number


- wheel scroll in opcodes and numbers panes not working in editor
- make it not possible to add breakpoints in comment lines?

- registers, watch - display can be hex/signed/unsigned

- mark failure point when player dies


- save entire state of game
