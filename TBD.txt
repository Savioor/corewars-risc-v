  resb 3000000000  -memory
  resb 4 - not displayed correctly as zeros

nasm stuck
  times 200000 inc bx

BUG - showing wrong bin for 'resb 5' in debugger 


disassembler bug
   hello db 10   - not enough bytes to parse, doesn't recognise it as db


graph window


nasm memory leak
   errors with dy 12, dz 12

check randomization similarity with real java

--------------------------------

disassembler incorrect??
   do something automatic that checks all disassembler



BUG fixed address:
[6] Player_A enters the arena at BF96
[6] Player_B enters the arena at BF96

CONCEPTUAL BUG:
  Two identical - in debug, must be able to select each of them
  their names in the output window is wrong
  maybe it was a bad idea

debugger

   show in red things that were just changed

   code with many comments

BUG indentation
   pressing enter in a line that already has text

- what happens if the war ends while on Resume? - need to pause


|| 
- hover on memory panel tells you what player it is
- pressing the player button shows where it is in the memory panel
- GUI-bug - there is no way to get to player 2 debug lines in the debugger

- colors on players pane

- breakpoints in edit
   - disallow setting in comment, label lines?

- data breakpoints

- online live game?
- enable/disable players with checkbox
- code button should be red if code has errors


- jump to line where mouse is pointing?

- remove trailing spaces and the bottom of the asm text, looks bad when debugging

- check changes:
    https://forum.codeguru.co.il/wp/?topic=silenterrors-debugger
    https://github.com/YoavKa/corewars8086/releases/tag/v5

- cpu view can change values, show in red and is able to revert?



- when not in debug mode don't update GUI

- go to address when not a number - same as watch parsing. problem - default would not be hex anymore
- labels from code in watch?
- check long pages of comments at the start of .asm and in the middle, in either the player above or in me

- all console.error, Console.error to message boxes
- disassembled asm does not compile 'MOV [SI], 0x7C6' missing 'byte' or 'word'



- don't disassemble lines that were in the original text
- export code to bin file

- fix colors to be consistant, IP pointer
- check timing of - main memory using an Int8Array from GWT


- after war ended, change stop icon to re-run?

- options window?


- add GUI indicator of steps/second

- stop when current debugged player dies
- check what happens in debugger at 200,000 steps



minor BUG - parsing an opcode out of memory boundary reads wrong number


- wheel scroll in opcodes and numbers panes not working in editor
- make it not possible to add breakpoints in comment lines?

- registers, watch - display can be hex/signed/unsigned




- save entire state of game
