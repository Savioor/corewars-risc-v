debugger

   show in red things that were just changed

   code with many comments

- on debug end, keep the war alive so that it would be possible to view state
  - what happens if the war ends while on Resume? - need to pause


|| 

- colors on players pane

- breakpoints in edit
   - disallow setting in comment, label lines?

- data breakpoints

- online live game?
- enable/disable players with checkbox
- code button should be red if code has errors
- add zombies

- jump to line where mouse is pointing?

- remove trailing spaces and the bottom of the asm text, looks bad when debugging

- check changes:
    https://forum.codeguru.co.il/wp/?topic=silenterrors-debugger
    https://github.com/YoavKa/corewars8086/releases/tag/v5

- cpu view can change values, show in red and is able to revert?

- try two players with the same name

- when not in debug mode don't update GUI

- go to address when not a number - same as watch parsing. problem - default would not be hex anymore
- check long pages of comments at the start of .asm and in the middle, in either the player above or in me

- all console.error, Console.error to message boxes
- disassembled asm does not compile 'MOV [SI], 0x7C6' missing 'byte' or 'word'



- don't disassemble lines that were in the original text
- export code to bin file

- fix colors to be consistant, IP pointer
- check timing of - main memory using an Int8Array from GWT


- after war ended, change stop icon to re-run?

- options window?


- add GUI indicator of steps/second

- stop when current debugged player dies
- check what happens in debugger at 200,000 steps



minor BUG - parsing an opcode out of memory boundary reads wrong number


- wheel scroll in opcodes and numbers panes not working in editor
- make it not possible to add breakpoints in comment lines?

- registers, watch - display can be hex/signed/unsigned




- save entire state of game
